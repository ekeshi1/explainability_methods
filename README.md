# explainability_methods_in_trashnet

This work was done as part of Pervasive Data Science seminar at University of Tartu (https://courses.cs.ut.ee/2022/pdss/spring/Main/HomePage)

##Short descriptions about operations performed in colab :

1. Trains a TrashNet model with 80 % accuracy. Model retrieved from (https://github.com/vasantvohra/TrashNet)
2. Implement LIME, SHAP values and Occlusion Sensitivity Mapping  methods to try to explain model's prediction.



## How to get up and running

1.Copy below folder in your google drive root folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KZ3gq_-cLDeT0se8GsjbglRqSjtUK2RW?usp=sharing.
It contains the pretrained model and the trashnet dataset. You can train the model again if you like.
2.Run the colab file.
